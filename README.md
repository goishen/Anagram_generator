# Anagram_generator
An anagram generator from Impractical Python Projects

I learned so much in this chapter, and I'm still not done with it.  Learned about the Counter() function.  Previously, I thought that all Python had was the enumerate() function.  I learned that the glob function accepts anything that you toss at it.  I knew about it in OS's, but didn't realize that there was something similar in programming.

I've learned a little about recursion, but I think the rest of the book is gonna teach me more.
